Drone is a Continuous Integration platform built on container technology. Every build is executed inside an ephemeral Docker container, giving developers complete control over their build environment with guaranteed isolation.

### Goals

Drone's prime directive is to help teams [ship code like GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1241-deploying-at-github#always-be-shipping). Drone is easy to install, setup and maintain and offers a powerful container-based plugin system. Drone aspires to be an industry-wide replacement for Jenkins.

### Documentation

Drone documentation is organized into several categories:

* [Setup Guide](http://readme.drone.io/docs/setup/)
* [Build Guide](http://readme.drone.io/docs/build/)
* [API Reference](http://readme.drone.io/docs/api/)

### Community

Contributions, questions, and comments are welcomed and encouraged. Drone developers hang out in the [drone/drone](https://gitter.im/drone/drone) room on [gitter](https://gitter.im/drone/drone).
