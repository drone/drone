## System Requirements

* Docker
* AUFS

We highly recommend running Docker with the AUFS storage driver. You can verify Docker is using
the AUFS storage driver with the following command `sudo docker info | grep Driver:`

## Installation

We have optimized the installation process for Ubuntu since that is what we test with internally. You can run the following commands to quickly download an install Drone on an Ubuntu machine.

```sh
wget downloads.drone.io/exp/drone.deb
sudo dpkg -i drone.deb
```

## Setup

We are in the process of moving configuration out of the UI and into configuration
files and/or environment variables (your choice which). If you prefer configuration files
you can provide Drone with the path to your configuration file:

```sh
./drone --config=/path/to/drone.conf

```

The configuration file is in TOML format:

```toml
[github]
client=""
secret=""

[github_enterprise]
client=""
secret=""
api=""
url=""

[bitbucket]
client=""
secret=""

[smtp]
host=""
port=""
from=""
user=""
pass=""
```

Or you can use environment variables

```sh
# github configuration
export DRONE_GITHUB_CLIENT=""
export DRONE_GITHUB_secret=""

# github enterprise configuration
export DRONE_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_CLIENT=""
export DRONE_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_SECRET=""
export DRONE_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_API=""
export DRONE_GITHUB_ENTERPRISE_URL=""

# bitbucket configuration
export DRONE_BITBUCKET_CLIENT=""
export DRONE_BITBUCKET_SECRET=""

# email configuration
export DRONE_SMTP_HOST=""
export DRONE_SMTP_PORT=""
export DRONE_SMTP_FROM=""
export DRONE_SMTP_USER=""
export DRONE_SMTP_PASS=""
```

## Compatibility Issues

**WARNING**

There were some fundamental changes to the application and we decided to introduce breaking changes to the dataabase. Migration would have been difficult and time consuming. Drone is an alpha product and therefore backward compatibility is not a primary goal until we hit a stable release. Apologizes for any inconvenience.
